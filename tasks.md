# Backend (OCaml):

- [ ] Set up the OCaml development environment with the necessary libraries and tools.
- [ ] Create a new OCaml project structure with appropriate directories for organizing code.
- [ ] Implement user registration and authentication functionality.
- [ ] Design and create the database schema for storing user information, workout logs, and performance metrics.
- [ ] Develop API endpoints for user authentication, workout logging, performance tracking, and exercise library management.
- [ ] Implement data validation and input sanitization to ensure the security and integrity of the application.
- [ ] Connect the backend to the database and handle database operations (e.g., CRUD operations for user accounts, workout logs, etc.).
- [ ] Implement data retrieval and manipulation logic to calculate performance metrics based on logged workouts.
- [ ] Integrate with external APIs if needed (e.g., for exercise data or performance analytics).
- [ ] Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of backend functionality.

# Frontend (Svelte):

- [ ] Set up the Svelte development environment and project structure.
- [ ] Design the user interface and create wireframes/mockups for different pages/screens.
- [ ] Implement user registration and login forms.
- [ ] Create components for the dashboard, workout logging, performance tracking, exercise library, and user profile.
- [ ] Develop forms for logging workouts, including exercise selection, sets, reps, weights, and other relevant data.
- [ ] Design and implement visual representations (charts, graphs, etc.) for displaying performance metrics.
- [ ] Implement responsive design to ensure the application works well on different screen sizes and devices.
- [ ] Integrate with the backend API endpoints to send and receive data (user authentication, workout logging, performance tracking, etc.).
- [ ] Implement client-side data validation and form handling to provide a smooth user experience.
- [ ] Write unit tests and conduct UI/UX testing to ensure proper functionality and usability.

# General Tasks:

- [ ] Set up version control (e.g., Git) and repository for collaborative development.
- [ ] Decide on a hosting solution for your backend and frontend (e.g., cloud platform, VPS, or serverless).
- [ ] Set up a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging mechanisms to track and debug issues.
- [ ] Apply appropriate security measures, including data encryption, secure communication (HTTPS), and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, Cross-Site Request Forgery).
- [ ] Conduct user testing and gather feedback to improve the application's usability and performance.
- [ ] Refactor and optimize code as needed to improve maintainability and performance.
